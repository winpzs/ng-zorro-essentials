# Angular Essentials - Extension Pack for VS Code

This extension pack for Visual Studio Code adds extensions that are amazingly useful for ng-alain development.

## Included

Here is the list of extensions the pack includes:

[ng-zorro snippets](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=cipchk.ng-zorro-vscode) - ng-zorro 的 vscode 代码片断

[Angular 5 Snippets](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Mikael.Angular-BeastCode) - Visual Studio Code TypeScript and Html snippets and code examples for Angular 2,4 & 5.

[Angular Language Service](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Angular.ng-template) - This extension provides a rich editing experience for Angular templates, both inline and external templates. This extension is brought to you by members of the Angular team. It is fantastic at helping write solid code in the html templates.

[Path Intellisense](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=christian-kohler.path-intellisense) - Visual Studio Code plugin that autocompletes filenames. Hopefully, VS Code will bake this in at some point. Until then, this is a keeper.

[Angular Inline](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=natewallace.angular2-inline) - Visual Studio Code language extension for javascript/typescript files that use Angular2.
